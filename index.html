                <p> After Peyton sent a friend request to Kieren on Facebook the day after the party, Kieren made the next move to organise a lunch date. We went to Sushi Train at Cairns Central for lunch on a random Wednesday. Peyton was late because she was coming from a shift at Bunnings and thought Kieren had left, but he was running errands while he waited for her. It was only after, that Kieren mentioned he doesn't really like sushi.</p>

              <p> After buying our house, we went into full pet crazy mode. Gaining another 3 pets in a little over 1.5 years. Still not sure if it was a good idea. </p>
              <h4>Louie</h4>
              <p> Kieren had wanted to get Charlie a friend for years, after negotiating to get an orange cat, we wasted no time and adopted Louie - who was 6 months old and found in Bundaberg, Queensland - a week after we moved into our house.</p>  
              <h4>Wilbur AKA Wilby</h4>  
              <p>Next up, Peyton wanted to try having a dog. On a whim, we chose Wilby - who was 9 months old - because he was being rehomed by a friend of a friend.</p>
              <h4> River</h4>  
              <p> Kieren wanted a Tuxedo cat after losing out to Peyton last time. We also decided to adopt a senior cat. We came across River who was 7 years old, and we had him flown down from Mareeba, Queensland. </p>

              <p>13 months after they agreed to get engaged, on a trip to the Toowoomba Flower Festival, Kieren pulled Peyton into a quiet garden area and proposed with a little speech, a family hierloom ring and a cheeky smile.</p>
              <p>Also, if anyone is doing the maths, yes 9.5 years is correct.</p>
              <p>A few weeks later, we got professional photos done to celebrate.</p>
              <h4>About the ring</h4>
              <p>The ring was passed down from Peyton's Great Great Great Aunt Maude Dunne (yes three greats) who was married on December 9 1916. Aunt Maude and her husband Harold never had any children so it slowly made it's way down the family via Peyton's maternal grandmother. When Peyton and Kieren agreed on getting engaged, Peyton asked her parents if we could have it, and they agreed. </p>

              <h3>They say 'I Do'- September 2028</h3>
              <p>Peyton and Kieren are eloping in Cradle Mountain, Tasmania in an intimate ceremony, just the two of them. The actual date is top secret, because we don't trust some of y'all not to rock up. Maybe we will tell you at the Post Elopement Celebration.</p>
